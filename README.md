# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting survival on the Titanic. The dataset is a classic machine learning problem that involves predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on these attributes.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution of features and relationships between variables.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features as necessary.
  
- **Model Building:** Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to predict survival probabilities.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to assess performance.
  
- **Deployment:** Deploy the best-performing model for inference on new data or in a production environment.
